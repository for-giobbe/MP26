- D. ... what time is it again?

**Which is not a perturbation approach?**

### Fill-in-the-blank questions:

**In phylogenetic analysis, a site is considered parsimony-informative if it contains at least _________________
diVerent character states, each represented in at least _________________ sequences.**

**The Markov property in substitution models states that the probability of a nucleotide changing from one state to
another depends only on its _________________ state, not on its _________________ one.**

**Sequence saturation occurs when multiple _________________ happen at the same site, making it hard to infer the
true number of _________________ between sequences.**
